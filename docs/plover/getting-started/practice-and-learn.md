## Practice and learn

It's time to start learning stenography theory for free, practicing writing using stenography, and learning how to make the most of Plover's built-in tools. See the [Learning Resources](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Learning-Stenography).

### Which steno theory should you learn?

There are many steno theories on the best way of using the steno keyboard.

All English language steno theories are derived from the original Stenotype theory devised by Ward Ireland. They all share the same keyboard design and basic method of representing the sounds. They differ mostly in the details of how they [brief](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Glossary#brief) words, and how many briefs they use. Some theories are focused on raw speed and efficiency, but require a lot of memorization. Others focus more on consistency and logical rules to reduce the amount of memorization and "on-the-job" mental gymnastics required.

We recommend you start with Plover's StenEd-based theory, and the dictionary that is supplied with the Plover software. After 6 months, you'll have a better understanding of stenography, and you could then start experimenting with different theories. Everyone ends up adapting them and forming a personal style anyway. So you don't need to worry about the different steno theories until you hit 100 WPM or so.

We don't recommend spending money on a theory before you're certain you like stenography.
