## Setting up my machine

Initially, Plover is set up to use your computer keyboard as a steno machine. If you have a steno machine, you'll need to configure Plover to look for your machine. Please check the [Supported Hardware page](/supported-hardware/supported-hardware.md) to find instructions specific to your machine.

### Use a standard QWERTY keyboard

**You can use Plover with a standard computer keyboard, but there are some important limitations.** Stenography often requires you to press 5 or 6 keys at once, and sometimes as many as 16. Unfortunately, most keyboards only recognize up to 1-6 keys at once. When you need to press more than 6 keys at once, you have to use a technique called "arpeggiating". See ["How it Works" for more information on arpeggiating](http://qwertysteno.com/Basics/HowItWorks.php).

> **Note**: To write quickly, you'll need a keyboard with N-key rollover (NKRO), a machine designed for use with Plover, or a professional stenography machine.

### Use an N-key rollover (NKRO) QWERTY keyboard

An N-key rollover (NKRO) keyboard is specially designed to allow pressing many keys at once. Some gaming or mechanical keyboards have NKRO. 

#### Which NKRO keyboard should I get?

> **Warning**: Be wary of false advertising; some keyboards are advertised as NKRO or anti-ghosting, but are limited to certain combinations. Check reviews to get confirmation before making a purchase. Some keyboards might only support full-NKRO over a PS/2 connector (the [old-style plug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port#/media/File:Ps-2-ports.jpg).) 

Full NKRO over USB is possible. Many keyboards do it well, and will work with Plover.

### Adapt a keyboard for steno use

Most keyboards have the keys in staggered rows, which can make it difficult to press two keys in a column with a single finger. To adapt a keyboard for steno, you can use:

* [Keytoppers](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Supported-Hardware#keytoppers)
* [Keycaps](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Supported-Hardware#keycaps)

You can also use [a keyboard with an ortholinear layout](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Supported-Hardware#nkro-keyboards-with-an-ortholinear-layout).

### Use a machine designed for use with Plover

Various steno enthusiasts are making and selling machines designed for use with Plover:

* [Georgi*](https://www.gboards.ca/product/georgi)
* [Splitography*](https://softhruf.love/products/soft-hruf-erl)
* [TinyMod*](https://stenomod.blogspot.com/2018/11/tinymod2.html)

### Use a professional stenography machine
 
Some professional stenography machines are compatible with Plover. You can find used steno machines on eBay at reasonable prices. 

See the [[Supported Hardware]] page for a list of supported professional stenography machines.
