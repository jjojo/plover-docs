Unsure which version to download? You have a few options, depending on your needsâ€¦
Most of the time, you'll want the [latest stable version](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/releases/latest). As at 26 Jan 2020, most folk on the [Plover Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0lQde43a6dGmAMp2) recommend v4.0.0. See the [latest weekly release](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/releases).
