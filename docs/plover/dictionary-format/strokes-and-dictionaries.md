## Strokes and Dictionaries 
If you are new to stenography:

- A _stroke_ is a group of keyboard keys that are pressed simultaneously to produce output. As soon as all keys on the keyboard are released, the steno machine sends out that entire chord of key presses as a stroke. 
- Plover converts that input into English words and phrases on the screen, by using _dictionaries_. 
- The dictionaries map a stroke (or a combination of strokes) to an English word or phrase, number, punctuation symbol, emoji, software command, or a meta command for controlling spacing and capitalization.
- Every stenographer creates their own customized dictionary to supplement or amend the default dictionary that comes with a steno application, such as Plover. By default, you add your customizations to the `user.json` dictionary that comes with Plover.
