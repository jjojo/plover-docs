## Sending Symbols

Since Plover 3.0.0, users can write full Unicode. You can use symbols in your JSON dictionary, or paste them into the "Add Translation" dialog (or into the dictionary manager). You can get symbols from a character insert panel in your operating system (if you have one), or you can copy and paste symbols from another application, such as a web browser.

```json
{
  "SHR*UG": "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
  "TR*PL": "{^}™",
  "TPHA*ES": "n̶o̶ yes"
}
```
