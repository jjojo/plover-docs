Plover (rhymes with "lover") is a free, open source stenography engine written in Python. Essentially it is _free stenography software_.

Before there was Plover, there was deposition software, often called CAT software. While this software is very useful for stenographers making depositions, it is not well-fitted to any other purpose. It is sandboxed, proprietary, and often bloated. Plover is a lightweight Python application that you run in the background. It acts as a translator to read steno movements and then emulate keystrokes, so the programs you use can't tell that you are using steno.

This means that you can use Plover to chat on Facebook, write into Microsoft Word, browse the web, control your media, use the commandline, fire off keyboard shortcuts, open and close programs, navigate with arrow keys, write code, or anything else you could do with a regular keyboard, but at much greater speeds!

Plover is used today by hundreds of people, with ranging skillsets. It is used by both professional stenographers, as well as transcriptionists, and by programmers. If you want to know more about the community, it's best to [join them for a chat](https://discord.gg/0lQde43a6dGmAMp2).
