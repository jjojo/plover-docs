## Laptops with NKRO

If you want to always have steno on the go, you might consider finding a notebook with NKRO. Note that not all these machines are equivalent in terms of actuation force or key shape. You might find, for example, that chiclet keys don't feel as good as the Alienware's classic keyboard style. It's always best to try laptop keyboards at a local store, if possible.
