| Product Name                       | Manufacturer       | About                   | Price |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----- |
| [Georgi](https://www.gboards.ca/product/georgi) | [g Heavy Industries](https://www.gboards.ca) | Portable, affordable, and light-touch option. Low-profile Kailh Choc switches with 20g-actuation springs swapped in makes this the lightest-touch and lowest-height machine made for Plover so far. The removal of a number bar reduces costs and weight for portability. A third thumb key is to be used as a number bar replacement like the TinyMod. See [Martin's Georgi Stand with Trackball review](https://stenoblog.com/georgi-stand-with-trackball/), [Mirabai's review](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2019/12/georgi-review.html), [Erik's Georgi Mount](https://www.erikto.com/tech/georgi-stand/), and [Josh's photos](https://gist.github.com/JoshuaGrams/f688ae7a14a995c78ed06d49402dea04). <br /> ![Georgi](https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/232702451/52661703_571704223305936_5341086750800347136_n.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=350) | $95 |
| [SOFT/HRUF Splitography](https://softhruf.love) | Scott Urueta | Open source hardware. This has the shape of a stenography machine, but is built using computer keys rather than levers. The name is the steno representation for, and is pronounced as, "soft love". The SOFT/HRUF uses Matias Red switches (~40g actuation). <br /> ![SOFT/HRUF](https://i.imgur.com/pvmzoQy.png) | $138 |
| Stenoboard | Utopen (Emanuele Caruso) | Open source hardware. The first open source steno machine on the market, released in 2014. The Stenoboard's keys actuate like mouse-clicks instead of a keyboard or lever-machine. ![](http://stenoboard.com/images/stenoboard.jpg)| Out of production |
| [Stenokey](https://github.com/mike-ady/Stenokey) | [mike-ady](https://github.com/mike-ady) | Stenokey is an open source do it yourself stenographic keyboard project. It is aimed at makers with some electronics experience (soldering) and who own a 3D printer or who have a friend with a 3D printer. <br /> ![Stenokey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mike-ady/Stenokey/master/Documentation/Stenokey.png) | DIY |
| [Stenomod](https://stenomod.blogspot.com) | Charley Shattuck | Open source hardware. This has light (35g actuation) keys and a split design. See [Ted Morin's review of the Stenomod](http://www.tedmor.in/blog/posts/stenomod-affordable-steno-machine) as well as [Martin KÃ¶rner's review](https://stenoblog.com/the-stenomod/). The name is supposed to hint at how the machine is "modular" and adaptable. <br /> ![Stenomod](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n7j50BDdjAg/WJECk94jwCI/AAAAAAAAAI4/2E-G1dgflccCltPFN9FEPI4QtMW62ttCQCK4B/s400/20170131_131923.jpgre) | Out of production |
| [TinyMod](https://stenomod.blogspot.com) | Charley Shattuck | Open source hardware. A smaller, nonsplit version of the Stenomod that omits the number bar in order to reduce costs and size. The center vowel key is used as a number bar replacement. See [Mirabai's review](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2019/12/tinymod-review.html). <br /> ![TinyMod](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EtmothiLtUo/XL4RrK7jw5I/AAAAAAAACTU/8TibacoLPuYBu6-nmPhaEQnVZsweVEp5gCLcBGAs/s400/20190422_120223.png) | $160 |
