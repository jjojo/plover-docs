# The Open Steno Project

The Open Steno Project aims to open up stenography to the general public. The Open Steno Project has manifested as efforts for free software, free learning resources, and open source hardware options. The project was founded by stenographer Mirabai Knight as a reaction to the closed down, proprietary nature of the court reporting industry.

To learn stenography in the early 2000s, an individual had to purchase or rent an expensive steno machine, attend college, and pay hundreds of dollars yearly for software. Imagine if, to learn piano, you had to purchase one and take out a student loan!

Mirabai initiated the development of a software called Plover and worked tirelessly with a growing community to break down barriers so that everyone who wanted to learn stenography could. Today, the Open Steno Project has enabled thousands to explore stenography without any upfront, much because of the development of Plover.

Stenography is useful for more than just court reporters. Typing at the speed of speech has many potential use cases for:

- Writers such as journalists or novelists üìñ
- Nonverbal individuals using a text-to-speech engine üì£
- Programmers who need to write documentation and use many symbols ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
- Anyone concerned about the ergonomics of typing üñê
- And people who just want to type really, really fast üöÄ

# Plover - The heart of the project <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Plover is at the heart of the Open Steno Project ‚ù§. Plover (rhymes with "lover") is a free, open source stenography engine written in Python. It allows individuals who learn stenography to write into any program at speeds of over 200 words per minute.

Plover is cross platform and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Read the [Plover](/plover/) section of this documentation to get started.
